### IoT Socket Streamer

Three different components that work together to stream sensor data from a Waveshare BME680 sensor to a web page with real-time updates via websockets. The components are:

- An `ESP32 Mini-1` microcontroller that uses [MicroPython](https://micropython.org) to read sensor data from a [Waveshare BME680 environmental sensor](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/Bme680#:~:text=Overview.%20A%20tiny%20sensor%20breakout%20with%20bme680,also%20is%20compatible%20with%203.3V/5V%20voltage%20levels.). Wi-Fi wasn't an option here (5GHz only network), so the microcontroller sends the data out via a serial connection (UART) instead. All of the hard work is done with a Micropython Driver for a BME680 breakout located this this repo: https://github.com/robert-hh/BME680-Micropython
  
- A client-side script written in [Go](https://go.dev) that reads from the serial port (the ESP32 Mini-1) and sends the data (via POST request in binary format) to a Golang server on a live domain (personal website). The script uses the wonderful [serial](https://github.com/bugst/go-serial) package to read from the serial port. The [serial package](https://pkg.go.dev/go.bug.st/serial) documentation is very helpful and the package is *very easy* to use.

- A server-side script written in [Go](https://go.dev) that listens for the incoming connentions (sensor data), processes via a `POST` request handler, and sends it to a client (an index.html file) via [Gorilla WebSocket](https://github.com/gorilla/websocket). The server is hosted on a live domain at https://jim3.xyz. The client is a simple HTML file (JS/HTML/Go templates) that connects to the server via a WebSocket connection and shows the sensor data updated in real-time.

### Usage

1. Connect the ESP32 to the BME680 sensor via I2C and connect the ESP32 to your computer via USB.

2. Start the server: `go run main.go`

3. Start the client script: `go run main.go`

4. Open the client in your browser: `http://localhost:8080`

### To Do

A lot that probably will never get finished ðŸ˜… ...refactor all of the code, add better error handling, make the landing page look nicer, add more sensors, etc...It's embarassingly basic...Go is so flexible, I had no idea it was as easy as it was for writing HTTP-based applications. It's definitely my new, favorite langauge.
